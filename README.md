# PROJECT

App focused on serving as an **informative space** regarding _LGPD - Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados_, with descriptive information regarding the regulation's legal criteria for _compliance_ and other _insights_ on implantation in a multitude of context. Users are also able to **keep track** of their progress through a checklist and a compartmentalized view of their compliance process informative dashboard.

## HOW IT WORKS

This app works as a tracking database for those looking to comply with LGPD in a practical way within their organization. You can register your organization under a bias and check your organization's progress through a descritive checklist and a dashboard to monitor your compliance status.
